# Mutating a single amino acid can make a protein fall apart, or make it tougher. That number
# is **ΔΔG** (delta-delta-G). Measuring it in the lab is slow and expensive, so we have labels for a vanishing
# fraction of possible mutations. Protein **structures**, meanwhile, are abundant and free.
#
# Throughout history, many approaches have been explored to try and solve this labeling cost problem. One of the possible answers to this question is **self-supervised learning**.
#
# Over the next several days, you will build a model that learns from protein structures with *no
# labels at all*, then ask whether that helped it predict stability. However counterintuitive it may sound, it is indeed possible!

# ### Roadmap
#
# | | | |
# |---|---|---|
# | **Part 1** | 🕸 What is a graph? | and why neural networks find them awkward |
# | **Part 2** | 🧠 Graph neural networks | you will build one from scratch |
# | **Part 3** | 🧬 Proteins as graphs | the biology you actually need |
# | **Part 4** | 🎭 Self-supervised learning | learning without labels, and how it fails |
# | **Part 5** | 🔮 JEPA | predict the representation, not the thing |
# | **Part 6** | 🕸🎭 SSL on graphs | what can you even hide? |
# | **Part 7** | 🛠 Build the model | your encoder, your objective |
# | **Part 8** | 📊 Pretrain, fine-tune, benchmark | the whole pipeline |
# | **Part 9** | 🔬 Go find something out | the actual project |
#
# ### The numbers you are aiming at
#
# ThermoMPNN (PNAS 2024) used this exact dataset and split:
#
# | | Spearman |
# |---|---|
# | their model, from scratch | **0.642** |
# | their model, with pretrained weights | **0.725** |
#
# You will not beat 0.725. That model is pretrained on the entire Protein Data Bank. The
# question is how far a small model *you* train gets, and whether pretraining helps.

# ### How to read this notebook
#
# Sections are marked so you know what is expected of you:
#
# | | |
# |---|---|
# | 📖 | **Read it.** Concepts, with as little hand-waving as we could manage. |
# | 🔍 | **Run it.** A demo. Read the code, predict the output, then run and see if you were right. |
# | 🛠 | **Write it.** Your turn. There is a `TODO` and a function that raises until you fill it in. |
# | ✅ | **Check it.** Call the checker. It tests properties, not just shapes, and gives hints when something is wrong. |
# | 🔬 | **Break it.** Open-ended. No checker, no right answer, just questions worth chasing. |
# | ⚠ | **A trap.** Something that will silently cost you a day if you do not know about it. |
#
# The checkers live in `gjepa/checks.py`. Go and read them whenever you like. Knowing what
# you are being tested on is half of knowing what to build.
#
# One habit worth forming right now: **before you run a demo cell, guess what it will print.**
# You will learn roughly ten times more from the cells where you guessed wrong.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Setting up
#
# **On Google Colab:** run the cell below first. It clones the project and installs what is
# missing. Colab already ships a working CUDA build of PyTorch, so we deliberately do not
# touch torch: installing another one on top is the usual way to break a Colab runtime. You
# will need to re-run this cell after every disconnect.
#
# **On your own machine:** do not run it. Run `./setup.sh` once in a terminal, then pick the
# `Python (sciml-gjepa)` kernel with Kernel > Change kernel.

# # Part 1: 🕸 What is a graph?
#
# ## 📖 Things that are graphs
#
# A graph is a set of **things** and a set of **connections between things**. That is the
# entire definition, and it is so general that it covers most of what people care about:
#
# * a road network: cities connected by roads
# * a social network: people connected by friendships
# * the internet: pages connected by links
# * a molecule: atoms connected by bonds
# * a protein: amino acids connected by physical contact
#
# We call the things **nodes** (or vertices) and the connections **edges**. Both can carry
# information. A node in a molecule knows which element it is. An edge knows whether it is a
# single or double bond.
#
# So far, so ordinary. The interesting part is what happens when you try to feed one of these
# into a neural network.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 📖 Why neural networks find graphs awkward
#
# Think about what a normal neural network expects. An image is a grid: every pixel has a
# position, every image of a given size has exactly the same number of pixels in exactly the
# same arrangement. A sentence is a sequence: word 1, word 2, word 3, in order. In both cases
# there is a fixed, meaningful ordering that you can rely on.
#
# A graph has neither.
#
# **There is no natural order.** If you have five atoms, which one is "atom number 1"? The
# answer is that there is no answer. You have to pick an order to store them in a computer,
# but that choice is arbitrary. And here is the problem: if you flatten your graph into a
# vector and feed it to an MLP, the network sees that arbitrary order as if it meant something.
# Relabel the atoms and the MLP gives you a different answer for the same molecule.
#
# **There is no fixed size.** One protein has 40 residues, another has 300. An MLP needs a
# fixed-size input.
#
# The property we want is called **permutation invariance**: relabelling the nodes must not
# change the answer. For a whole-graph prediction (is this molecule toxic?) the output should
# be identical. For a per-node prediction (is this residue buried?) the outputs should come back
# in the same permuted order, which is called **permutation equivariance**.
#
# Almost everything about graph neural networks follows from taking this one requirement
# seriously.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 🔍 Demo 1.1: the same graph, stored two different ways
#
# Two common representations. The **adjacency matrix** is an `N x N` table where entry
# `(i, j)` is 1 if there is an edge from `i` to `j`. The **edge list** (PyTorch Geometric calls
# it `edge_index`) is a `2 x E` array listing the source and destination of every edge.
#
# For a protein with 300 residues and 5000 contacts, the adjacency matrix has 90,000 entries
# of which 5000 are non-zero. The edge list has 10,000 numbers and no waste. That is why
# essentially every graph library uses edge lists.
#
# **Guess before you run:** we build a graph, then relabel the nodes. Which representation
# will look obviously different, and which will look subtly different?

# %%
# A tiny graph:   0 --- 1 --- 2 --- 3      and node 4 all on its own
edge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3],      # source
                           [1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2]])     # destination
num_nodes = 5

logger.info("after relabelling, the SAME graph looks like this:")
logger.info(f"\n{to_adjacency(relabelled, num_nodes)}")
logger.warning("Same graph. Completely different matrix. This is the problem.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## 📖 What lives on the nodes and edges
#
# A bare graph is just wiring. To do anything useful you attach data:
#
# * **node features** `x`, shape `[num_nodes, num_node_features]`. For us: which of the 20
#   amino acids this residue is.
# * **edge features** `edge_attr`, shape `[num_edges, num_edge_features]`. For us: how far
#   apart the two residues are in space, and how far apart they are along the chain.
#
# One habit to build early: **`edge_index[0]` is the source and `edge_index[1]` is the
# destination.** Information flows from source to destination. Getting this backwards is the
# single most common bug in hand-written GNN code, and on an undirected graph, where every
# edge has its reverse, it produces *exactly the right answer* and hides until the day you use
# a directed graph. One of the checkers below is built specifically to catch it.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 🛠 Exercise 1.1: node degrees
#
# The **degree** of a node is how many edges point at it. It is the simplest possible thing you
# can compute from a graph, and it is genuinely useful: in a protein, a residue with a high
# degree is packed in the core, and a residue with a low degree is out on the surface flapping
# around in the solvent. Buried residues are the ones where mutations hurt.
#
# Write it without a Python loop over nodes. The tool you want is `Tensor.index_add_`, which
# takes a list of indices and adds a value at each one. That single operation is the beating
# heart of every GNN in this notebook, so it is worth meeting it now on something easy.
#
# ```python
# counts = torch.zeros(5)
# counts.index_add_(0, torch.tensor([1, 1, 3]), torch.ones(3))
# # counts is now [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]
# ```

# # Part 2: 🧠 Graph neural networks
#
# ## 📖 The one idea
#
# We need an operation that is local, shared, and does not care about node order. Here it is:
#
# > **Every node looks at its neighbours, summarises what it sees, and updates itself.
# > Everyone does this at the same time, using the same rule.**
#
# That is a graph neural network layer. Repeat it `K` times and information travels `K` hops.
#
# Why does this satisfy permutation invariance? Because "the set of my neighbours" has no
# order in it. As long as your summary of that set does not depend on the order you happen to
# visit them in, relabelling the graph cannot change anything. This is why the summarising step
# is always something like a sum, a mean, or a max, and never something like "concatenate them
# in order".
#
# The standard way to write it:
#
# $$h_v^{(k)} = \text{COMBINE}\Big(h_v^{(k-1)},\ \text{AGGREGATE}\big(\{\,h_u^{(k-1)} : u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\,\}\big)\Big)$$
#
# and if you want one vector for the whole graph at the end,
#
# $$h_G = \text{READOUT}\big(\{\,h_v^{(K)} : v \in G\,\}\big)$$
#
# Every named architecture you have heard of (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN) is a different choice
# of AGGREGATE and COMBINE. That is the whole design space. If you wanted to invent your own
# layer this afternoon, you would be picking those two functions.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 🔍 Demo 2.1: watch information spread
#
# Put a signal of 1 on node 0, zeros everywhere else. Each round, every node adds up what its
# neighbours have. Nothing else, no weights, no learning.
#
# **Guess before you run:** after how many rounds does node 4, at the far end of the chain,
# first hear anything from node 0?

# %%
# a path graph:  0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
path = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4],
                     [1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3]])
n = 5

h = torch.zeros(n, 1); h[0] = 1.0
logger.info(f"start  {h.squeeze().tolist()}")

for step in range(4):
    src, dst = path
    msg = torch.zeros_like(h)
    msg.index_add_(0, dst, h[src])       # <-- THE core operation of every GNN
    h = h + msg
    logger.info(f"hop {step + 1}  {[round(v, 1) for v in h.squeeze().tolist()]}")

logger.info("Node 4 hears nothing until hop 4. One hop per layer, always.")

# %% [markdown]
# That last line is more important than it looks. **A GNN with `K` layers can only ever see
# `K` hops away.** If two residues need to influence each other and they are six hops apart in
# your contact graph, a two-layer network is physically incapable of connecting them. No amount
# of training fixes it.
#
# This is why people build deeper GNNs. It is also why deeper GNNs often get *worse*, which we

#
# * ⚠ **Direction.** Gather from `edge_index[0]`, scatter into `edge_index[1]`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 📖 Sum or mean? The question is not cosmetic
#
# It feels like a detail. It is not. It decides what your network is *capable* of representing,
# and there is a clean piece of theory behind it.
#
# Consider two nodes. The first has neighbours carrying features `{a, a, b, b}`. The second has
# neighbours carrying `{a, b}`. These are different neighbourhoods, and a good network should
# be able to tell them apart.
#
# Now:
#
# * **sum** gives `2a + 2b` and `a + b`. Different. Fine.
# * **mean** gives `(a+b)/2` in both cases. **Identical.** The mean has thrown away the fact
#   that one node has twice as many neighbours.
# * **max** gives `max(a,b)` in both cases. **Identical** as well.
#
# The mean and the max are *lossy summaries of a multiset*. The sum is not: it is injective,
# meaning different multisets always give different sums. This is the core argument of
# **GIN** (Xu et al., *How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?*, 2019), which proves that a
# GNN using sum aggregation is exactly as discriminative as the **Weisfeiler-Leman graph
# isomorphism test**, and that mean and max aggregation are strictly weaker.
#
# **Why you should care in this project.** Protein stability depends on things like how many
# hydrophobic neighbours a residue has. A mean-aggregating network is structurally blind to
# that difference. It is not a matter of training longer.

# If you got both, you have just shown that **no single aggregator dominates**. Sum is the most
# expressive for counting, but real architectures sometimes combine several
# (`PNAConv` in PyTorch Geometric uses four at once) precisely because each one is blind to
# something different.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 📖 From aggregation to an actual layer
#
# Aggregation is the AGGREGATE half. A layer also needs COMBINE: how a node mixes the summary
# of its neighbours with what it already knew about itself.
#
# The simplest version that works:
#
# $$h_v' = \sigma\Big(W_{\text{self}}\, h_v + W_{\text{neigh}} \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} h_u\Big)$$
#
# Keeping a separate weight matrix for the node itself matters. If you just throw the node in
# with its neighbours, the network cannot distinguish "I am hydrophobic and my neighbours are
# not" from the reverse.
#
# One more piece, and this one is not optional in practice: a **residual connection**, meaning
# you add the input back to the output. Without it, deep GNNs suffer from **over-smoothing**,
# where repeated averaging makes every node's representation converge to the same vector.
# After enough layers every residue in your protein looks identical, which is not a useful
# state of affairs. Demo 2.3 shows this happening.

# Build a layer as an `nn.Module`. Signature: `forward(x, edge_index) -> [num_nodes, out_dim]`.
#
# The checker tests four properties, and they are worth reading before you start because they
# tell you exactly what "being a GNN layer" means:
#
# 1. it returns one row per node

# ## 📖 Readout: from nodes to a graph
#
# Sometimes you want one vector for the whole graph. The rule is the same as before: whatever
# you do must not depend on node order. So: sum, mean, or max over all nodes.
#
# And the same expressiveness argument applies. Sum-pooling can tell a graph apart from two
# disconnected copies of itself. Mean-pooling cannot, because the average is unchanged.
#
# ⚠ In this project we do **not** use readout for the final prediction, and it is worth
# understanding why now. ΔΔG is a question about **one specific residue**: what happens if I
# change *this* amino acid? Squashing the protein into a single vector throws away exactly the
# information we need. We will keep per-residue embeddings all the way through. This turns out
# to matter a great deal in Part 7.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 🛠 Exercise 2.5: readout
#
# When you batch several graphs together, PyTorch Geometric stacks all their nodes into one
# big tensor and gives you a `batch` vector saying which graph each node came from:
# `batch = [0,0,0,1,1,2]` means the first three nodes are graph 0, the next two are graph 1,
# and the last is graph 2.
#
# Sum the node features within each graph. Same tool as always.

# ## 📖 The layers you will actually use
#
# You have now built the machinery by hand, so the named architectures should look like small
# variations rather than magic:
#
# | layer | AGGREGATE | uses edge features? | notes |
# |---|---|---|---|
# | **GCN** | normalised mean | no (scalar weights only) | the classic, cheap, blind to counting |
# | **GraphSAGE** | mean or max | no | keeps a separate self-weight |
# | **GAT / GATv2** | weighted mean (attention) | yes | learns which neighbours matter |
# | **GIN / GINE** | **sum** | GINE yes, GIN no | maximally expressive under 1-WL |
#
# ⚠ Look hard at the "uses edge features" column. Our edges carry the **distance between
# residues**, which is most of the geometric information in a protein structure. Pick `GCNConv`
# or `SAGEConv` and you throw all of it away before training even starts. Your model will still
# run. It will just be working blindfolded.
#
# > ⚠ **Attention is a weighted mean.** GAT's coefficients are softmax-normalised, so they sum
# > to 1. In theory that means GAT inherits mean's counting weakness. Whether it does in
# > practice, on this task, is genuinely open, and it is one of the experiments in Part 9.

# # Part 3: 🧬 Proteins as graphs
#
# ## 📖 What a protein is, in five paragraphs
#
# A protein is a chain. The links in the chain are **amino acids**, also called **residues**,
# and there are twenty different kinds. Your cells build a protein by stringing them together
# in an order written down in your DNA. A small protein might be 50 residues long, a large one
# a few thousand.
#
# The twenty residues differ in what hangs off the side of the chain. Some side chains are
# **hydrophobic**, meaning they hate water. Some are **polar** or **charged**, meaning they get
# along with water fine. Some are big, some are tiny, one of them (proline) is so awkwardly
# shaped that it puts a kink in the chain wherever it appears.
#
# Now drop that chain into water. The hydrophobic residues are miserable, so the chain
# scrunches up to bury them in the middle, away from the water, while the polar ones stay on
# the outside. It does this fast, in microseconds to seconds, and it does it **reproducibly**:
# the same sequence gives you the same shape every time. That shape is called the **fold**, and
# it is what the protein actually does its job with.
#
# The fold is held together by a large number of individually weak interactions. Physicists
# will recognise the setup: the folded state sits at a free energy minimum, and the quantity
# that matters is the **difference** in free energy between folded and unfolded. That is **ΔG**.
# A bigger ΔG means a more stable protein, one that needs more heat or more denaturant before
# it falls apart.
#
# Now mutate one residue. Replace a buried hydrophobic one with a charged one and you have
# just put a charge in the greasy core, which the protein hates, so ΔG drops and the protein
# is less stable. The change in stability is **ΔΔG = ΔG(mutant) − ΔG(wild type)**, and it is
# the number we are going to predict. Negative means the mutation destabilises.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 📖 Why we need the structure and not just the sequence
#
# Here is the thing that makes this a graph problem rather than a text problem.
#
# Whether a mutation hurts depends almost entirely on **where the residue sits in the folded
# structure**. The same substitution, say leucine to aspartate, is catastrophic if the residue
# is buried in the core and completely harmless if it is out on the surface. Two residues that
# are 80 positions apart in the sequence can be pressed against each other in the fold.
#
# A model that only sees the sequence has to infer all of that indirectly. A model that sees
# the structure gets it for free. So:
#
# * **node** = one residue, carrying which amino acid it is
# * **edge** = two residues that are close in 3D space
# * **edge features** = how far apart in space, and how far apart along the chain
#
# We place each residue at the position of its **Cα atom**, the central carbon of the backbone.
# It is a coarse summary of where the residue is, and it is enough.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 📖 A short history, and what each era got wrong
#
# **Autoencoders (2006 onward).** Squeeze the input through a bottleneck and reconstruct it.
# If a small vector is enough to rebuild the input, that vector must have captured something.
# True, but what it captures is whatever is cheapest to compress, which is often not what you
# want.
#
# **Word embeddings (2013).** word2vec: predict a word from its neighbours. The famous result
# was that arithmetic started working, `king - man + woman ≈ queen`. This was the first loud
# demonstration that a made-up prediction task could produce genuinely useful representations.
#
# **Pretext tasks (2015 to 2018).** Invent a puzzle whose answer you already know. Cut an image
# into tiles and predict their arrangement, like a jigsaw. Rotate an image by 0, 90, 180 or 270
# degrees and predict the rotation. Remove the colour and predict it back. These worked, but the
# tasks were arbitrary, and a network good at predicting rotation learns rotation-relevant
# features, which may or may not overlap with what you actually needed. The features were a
# side effect.
#
# **Contrastive learning (2018 to 2020).** Stop inventing puzzles. Take two random crops of the
# same photo and say "these two should have similar representations", then take a crop of a
# different photo and say "this one should be different". SimCLR and MoCo. It worked very well
# and it cost two things: you need a lot of negative examples in every batch, and your results
# depend enormously on exactly which augmentations you chose.
#
# > **Figure to add.** SimCLR Figure 2 is drawn in TikZ, so it is not in the arXiv
# > source and `scripts/fetch_figures.py` cannot pull it. Open
# > <https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2002.05709>, save Figure 2 as
# > `figures/simclr_framework.png`, then replace this block with an image tag.
#
# **Non-contrastive (2020 to 2021).** BYOL showed you can throw away the negatives entirely and
# still not collapse, using an asymmetry between two branches. This surprised people enough
# that a small literature appeared arguing about why it works at all.
#
# **Masked modelling (2018 to 2022).** Hide part of the input and reconstruct it. BERT did it
# for text and changed the field. MAE did it for images by masking 75% of the patches and
# rebuilding the pixels.

# ## 📖 The failure mode that will bite you: collapse
#
# Every method above that says "make these two representations similar" has an embarrassing
# trivial solution:
#
# > **map every possible input to the same constant vector.**
#
# The two representations are now perfectly similar. Loss zero. Congratulations, your model has
# learned the number 7 and nothing else.
#
# There are two flavours and the second is far more dangerous:
#
# * **complete collapse.** Every output is identical. Obvious the moment you look.
# * **dimensional collapse.** Outputs do vary, but only inside a tiny subspace of the embedding
#   space. Most directions carry no information at all. **The loss looks completely healthy.**
#
# We hit dimensional collapse in this very project. Our pretrained encoder was using roughly
# **3 of its 128 dimensions**, and the loss curve was beautiful the whole time.
#
# So: **watch the spread of your embeddings, not the loss.** A loss going to zero while the
# variance goes to zero is not a good run. It is the model finding the exit.

# position paper, *A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence*
# ([OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf)).
#
# Start with what is wrong with masked reconstruction. Mask a patch of an image and ask a model
# to fill in the pixels. To do well it has to commit to an exact answer: this pixel is
# `(137, 92, 40)`. But much of that detail is genuinely unknowable from the context. The exact
# texture of the grass, the precise noise pattern. The model spends real capacity getting those
# right, and they were never the point.
#
# The protein version is sharper. Mask a loop on the surface of a protein and ask what is there.
# Loops are floppy. There may be several perfectly reasonable answers. Forcing the model to
# pick one and punishing it for the others is teaching it something false.
#
# LeCun's move:
#
# > **Do not predict the input. Predict its representation.**
#
# An encoder is allowed to **throw away** whatever it cannot predict. If the exact loop
# conformation is unknowable, the representation simply does not encode it, and the prediction
# task stops asking about it.
#
# That freedom to discard is the whole idea. It is also, and you saw this coming, exactly why
# these models collapse: discarding **everything** is also a solution.

#
# | | predicts what? | needs negatives? | needs augmentations? | collapse prevented by |
# |---|---|---|---|---|
# | **Contrastive** (SimCLR) | agreement between two augmented views | **yes** | yes, and results depend heavily on them | pushing negatives apart |
# | **Masked autoencoder** (MAE) | **the masked input itself** | no | no | cannot collapse, but spends capacity on unpredictable detail |
# | **BYOL / SimSiam** | the representation of **another augmented view of the same input**, so it learns *invariance to augmentation* | no | **yes, they are the entire signal** | stop-grad + predictor + EMA |
# | **JEPA** | the representation of a **different part** of the input, told *where* that part is, so it learns *predictive structure* | no | no | stop-grad + EMA + weak predictor |
#
# > **One sentence worth memorising.**
# > MAE predicts the input. BYOL predicts a distorted copy of the input's representation.
# > **JEPA predicts the representation of a different piece of the input, told only where that
# > piece is.**
#
# That "told only where" is why the I-JEPA authors describe their predictor as a *primitive

# ## 📖 The trap that does not exist in image-land
#
# Image augmentations are safe by construction. Rotate a cat, still a cat. Adjust the
# brightness, still a cat. The label survives whatever you do.
#
# **Graph augmentations are not safe.** Delete one atom from a molecule and you have a
# different molecule with different chemistry. Drop the wrong contact in a protein and you may
# have removed the interaction holding two helices together.
#
# This is why GraphCL, one of the best-known graph contrastive papers, is largely an empirical
# study of *which augmentations to use on which dataset*. There is no universally safe recipe,
# because the augmentation that preserves the label for social networks destroys it for
# molecules.
#
# It is also the strongest argument for using JEPA on graphs specifically: **it needs no
# augmentations at all.**

# %% [markdown]
# ## 🔍 Demo 6.1: how dangerous is an augmentation, really?
#
# Two standard graph augmentations on a real protein. One of them is a catastrophe and the
# other is almost harmless, and **which is which is not obvious in advance**. That is the real

# **Read those two against each other.**
#
# **Node dropping is a disaster, and a silent one.** Deleting a single residue shifts every
# position after it by one. In this project every ΔΔG label is indexed by position, so this
# augmentation would quietly mislabel almost the entire training set while everything continued
# to run without a single error message.
#
# **Edge dropping is surprisingly benign.** A k-nearest-neighbour contact graph carries enough
# redundancy that even removing half the contacts leaves nearly every residue still anchored.
#
# Neither of those was obvious before measuring. If you use augmentations in Part 9, measure
# first.

# ## 📖 Be sceptical: the honest literature
#
# Before you get attached to any of this, read these three. They are the reason this notebook
# insists on proper controls.
#
# * **"Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines"**
#   ([arXiv 2509.01541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01541), 2025). Randomly initialised,
#   completely **untrained** GNNs frequently match or beat graph contrastive methods. On some
#   datasets a handcrafted degree histogram wins outright.
# * **Errica et al., "A Fair Comparison of GNNs for Graph Classification"**
#   ([arXiv 1912.09893](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09893), ICLR 2020). On several standard
#   benchmarks, **no GNN beat a baseline that ignored the graph structure entirely.**
# * **"Does GNN Pretraining Help Molecular Representation?"**
#   ([arXiv 2207.06010](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06010), NeurIPS 2022). Self-supervised graph
#   pretraining often gives no statistically significant gain at all.
#
# The control that matters most is the **randomly initialised encoder**. If your pretrained
# model cannot beat random weights, you have learned nothing, and you would be surprised how
# often that control is quietly missing from published work. You will run it in Part 8.

# ## 🛠 Exercise 6.1: masking a structural region
#
# Now the piece our model actually needs.
#
# Instead of scattering masked residues randomly through the protein, hide a **contiguous piece

#
# Why it matters. If you mask at random, almost every hidden residue still has unmasked
# neighbours on both sides, so the model can fill it in from local context without
# understanding anything. Masking a whole region forces it to reason about a piece of structure
# it genuinely cannot see. This is the direct analogue of I-JEPA taking large contiguous

# # Part 7: 🛠 Build the model
#
# ## 📖 What we are building, and one design decision worth arguing about
#
# Everything comes together here. The pretraining task, in one sentence:
#
# > Hide the **identity** of a contiguous region of residues, leave the **structure** completely
# > visible, and predict the **representations** of the hidden residues.
#
# Read that again and notice what is and is not hidden. Every edge, every distance, every
# coordinate stays exactly where it was. Only the answer to "which amino acid is this?" is
# removed. So the model is being asked:
#
# > *Given the shape of the pocket, what belongs in it?*
#
# That question is almost exactly the downstream question. ΔΔG asks: *how bad is it to put
# something else in this pocket?* The pretraining task and the real task share their inductive
# bias, which is the best thing you can hope for from self-supervised pretraining.
#
# ### The design decision
#
# The original Graph-JEPA paper ([arXiv 2309.16014](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16014)) is a
# **graph-level** method. It chops the graph into patches, turns each patch into a single
# vector, and plays I-JEPA on those patch vectors. It produces one representation per graph.
#
# We are not doing that, and the reason is worth understanding because it is the kind of
# judgement call you will have to make yourself in Part 9.
#
# ΔΔG is a **per-residue** question. A graph-level representation has already thrown away the
# information about which residue is which. Worse, in the graph-level design the EMA machinery
# lives in the patch-token Transformer, which means that when you move to the downstream task
# you can only reuse the small GNN underneath it and you discard most of what was pretrained.
# I-JEPA transfers its *big* encoder; a naive graph-level port transfers the small one.
#
# So we work at the residue level. The encoder **is** the GNN, which means 100% of what you
# pretrain is what you fine-tune.

# <sub>Skenderi et al., <i>Graph-level Representation Learning with JEPA</i>, TMLR 2024. Note step (b): the graph is cut into subgraph patches, and each becomes one token. We work at the residue level instead, for the reason given above.</sub>

# ## 🛠 Exercise 7.1: the protein encoder
#
# One embedding per residue. Signature: `forward(x, edge_index, edge_attr) -> [num_residues, dim]`.
#
# You have two helpers already written, because turning raw integers and distances into vectors
# is fiddly and not the interesting part:
#
# * `ResidueEncoder(dim)` maps an amino-acid index to a vector. ⚠ Note that `x` holds
#   **category indices**, not numbers with magnitudes. Amino acid 7 is not "seven times" amino
#   acid 1. Feeding these into a `Linear` would silently invent an ordering that does not exist,
#   which is why it goes through an `Embedding` instead.
# * `GeometricEdgeEncoder(dim)` maps `(distance, sequence separation)` to a vector. It expands
#   the distance into a set of radial basis functions first, which hands the network a smooth
#   local basis rather than making it learn a sharp non-linearity from one scalar.
#
# Use `GINEConv`, which consumes edge features. Two layers is plenty to start. Put a residual
# connection around each one, for the reason you saw in Demo 2.3.
#
# The checker verifies your encoder actually **uses** all three inputs: the graph, the
# distances, and the residue identities. It is surprisingly easy to build something that
# silently ignores one of them.

# ## 📖 Fine-tuning on ΔΔG
#
# Now the labels. To predict the effect of mutating residue `i`, the head gets three things:
#
# * the encoder's embedding **at residue i**
# * which amino acid **was** there
# * which amino acid is there **now**
#
# One trick makes this fast. Every mutation of a given protein shares the same wild-type
# structure, so we encode each structure **once** and score all of its ~900 mutations from the
# cached embeddings. 215,000 training examples collapse into about 30 forward passes per epoch.
#
# We train **two models**: one starting from your pretrained encoder, one from random weights.
# Same architecture, same data, same budget. The gap between them is what pretraining is worth,
# and it is the only number in this notebook that actually answers the question we started with.
#
# ⚠ `freeze=True` trains only the head and keeps the encoder fixed. That is how ThermoMPNN uses
# ProteinMPNN, and in our experiments it is where the pretraining advantage shows up at all.
# With full fine-tuning both arms converge to about the same place, because 350 steps of
# gradient is enough to overwrite whatever the pretraining put there. Try both. The difference
# between those two settings is one of the more interesting findings available to you here.

# ## 📊 The benchmark
#
# Report all three numbers, because they measure different things and they do not always agree:
#
# * **Spearman**: does the model rank mutations correctly overall?
# * **per-protein Spearman**: does it rank correctly *within* a single protein? This is closer
#   to what a protein engineer actually wants, since they are choosing between mutations of one
#   protein.
# * **RMSE**: are the predicted numbers the right size, not just the right order?
#
# When they disagree, that is information rather than an annoyance.

# # Part 9: 🔬 Go find something out
#
# Everything above is scaffolding. **This is the project.**
#
# Pick a question. Run it properly. Report what you found, including if what you found is
# "no difference", which is a real result and a more useful one than a cherry-picked win.
#
# ## Questions we already know are interesting
#
# **A. Frozen or fine-tuned?**
# Freeze the encoder and pretraining helps clearly. Fine-tune the whole thing and the advantage
# mostly vanishes, because the gradient overwrites what was learned. What learning rate, or
# what gradual-unfreezing schedule, keeps the benefit? This is a real open question and the
# answer is useful to anyone doing transfer learning.
#
# **B. How much unlabelled data do you actually need?**
# Pretrain on 500, 2000, 6782 structures (`load_scop(limit=...)`). Does the benefit grow
# steadily, or plateau? Where is the knee in the curve?
#
# **C. Which GNN layer?**
# `cfg.conv_type` accepts `GINEConv`, `GCNConv`, `SAGEConv`, `GATv2Conv`, `TransformerConv`.
# Remember Demo 2.2: sum counts and mean does not. Remember also that `GCNConv` and `SAGEConv`
# **cannot see edge features at all**, so they discard every distance in the structure.
# **Predict the ordering before you run it**, then check. Being wrong here is more interesting
# than being right.
#
# **D. What should you hide, and how much?**
# Contiguous region or scattered residues (`cfg.mask_mode`)? 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%
# (`cfg.mask_ratio`)? MAE found 75% best for images. Proteins are not images.
#
# **E. Latent or literal?**
# Change the objective to predict the masked residues' *identities* (a 20-way classification)
# instead of their representations. That is a masked autoencoder, and it is what Pythia does
# for this exact task. Which wins, and on which metric? This is the JEPA-versus-MAE question on
# real data, and as far as we can tell nobody has published the comparison.
#
# **F. Is your model just saying "destabilising"?**
# 77% of the data is destabilising. Evaluate on the stabilising mutations alone. Does your
# Spearman survive? Most published models struggle badly here, and it is a known open problem
# in the field rather than a flaw in your code.
#
# **G. Better features.**
# We use only Cα atoms. Serious models use the full backbone (N, Cα, C, O) and dihedral angles.
# That gap is most of why we score around 0.59 and ThermoMPNN scores 0.642. Add backbone
# geometry and see how much you close.
#
# ## How to report anything
#
# For every claim you make:
#
# * **several seeds**, with an error bar. Not one run.
# * the **random-initialisation control**, every time.
# * say which metric you are quoting, and do not switch metrics between experiments.
# * if your confidence interval crosses zero, say so plainly.
#
# The most valuable thing you can produce this week is a result you believe for good reasons.
# Good luck.
